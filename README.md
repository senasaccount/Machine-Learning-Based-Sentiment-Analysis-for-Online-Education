# Machine Learning Based Sentiment Analysis for Online-Education
Welcome to the Machine Learning Based Sentiment Analysis for Online-Education repository. This project involves the analysis of a dataset extracted from Twitter using the snscrape library in Python. The dataset consists of 10,000 tweets, each of which has been labeled according to its sentiment using the TextBlob library. This labeled data has been divided into training and testing datasets, and various machine learning algorithms have been applied to classify the sentiment of the tweets. The performance of Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes algorithms has been assessed, and accuracy rates have been obtained.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 10,000 tweets extracted from Twitter using the snscrape Python library. Each tweet in the dataset has been labeled according to its sentiment using the TextBlob library. 

# Dataset Overview
Total Tweets: 10,000
Columns: Tweet ID, Tweet Text, Sentiment Label.

# Analysis Highlights
In this project, the following steps were performed:

Data Collection: Extraction of 10,000 tweets using snscrape from Twitter.

Sentiment Labeling: Application of TextBlob sentiment analysis to label each tweet.

Data Splitting: Division of labeled data into training and testing sets.

Machine Learning: Training of Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes models.

Evaluation: Calculation of accuracy rates for each model on the testing dataset.
